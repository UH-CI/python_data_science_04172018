This FREE workshop is sponsored by the Hawai'i Data Science Institue and the University of Hawai'i Information Technology Service Cyberinfrastructure group and Hawai'i EPSCoR.


This workshop focuses specifically on the Python skills necessary for data analysis -- as opposed to software development -- and introduces some of the libraries that have made Python a popular alternative for working with data at any scale.

## Takeaways:

### By the end of this workshop students will be able to:
* Work with the Pandas library to conduct essential data analysis tasks such as reading, exploring, filtering, and summarizing data.
* Slice, shape and pivot tables.
* Implement calculations on rows, columns, and tables.
* Use split-apply-combine to summarize data
* Merge, concatenate and filter data from multiple sources.
* Visualize data using matplotlib

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. Laptops will require a browser application for accessing jupyter notebooks resources.
