This FREE workshop is sponsored by the Hawai'i Data Science Institue and the University of Hawai'i Information Technology Service Cyberinfrastructure group and Hawai'i EPSCoR.


This workshop focuses specifically on the Python skills necessary for data analysis -- as opposed to software development -- and introduces some of the libraries that have made Python a popular alternative for working with data at any scale.

## Takeaways:

### By the end of this workshop students will be able to:
* Work with the Pandas library to conduct essential data analysis tasks such as reading, exploring, filtering, and summarizing data.
* Slice, shape and pivot tables.
* Implement calculations on rows, columns, and tables.
* Use split-apply-combine to summarize data
* Merge, concatenate and filter data from multiple sources.
* Visualize data using matplotlib

Participants should bring their laptops and plan to participate actively. Laptops will require a browser application for accessing jupyter notebooks resources.

## Required Software Installation

### Installing the Python environment with Anaconda
Python is a popular language for research computing, and great for general-purpose programming as well. Installing all of its research
packages individually can be a bit difficult, so we recommend Anaconda, an all-in- one installer. Regardless of how you choose to
install it, make sure you install Python version 3.6.
We will extensively use the Jupyter programming environment that runs in a web browser. For this to work you will need a reasonably up-
to-date browser. The current versions of the Chrome, Safari and Firefox browsers are all supported (some older browsers, including Internet Explorer version 9 and below, are not).

### Installation Instructions for Windows
Browse to <a href="http://continuum.io/downloads">http://continuum.io/downloads</a> Download the Python
installer for Windows Install Python 3.6 using all of the defaults for
installation except make sure to check “Make Anaconda the default
Python”

### Installation Instructions for Mac OS X
